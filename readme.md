This work presents a sub-optimal multi-objective SFC Deployment framework for the particular case of a multi-cloud Live-Video v-CDN using an Enhanced Exploration - Dense reward mechanism over a Dueling-architectured Double Deep Q Network, _E2-D4QN_. Trace-driven simulations reveal that our approach is the only one adapt to the complexity of the particular context of Live-Video v-CDN with respect to the state-of-art algorithms designed for general-case SFC deployment. In particular, our simulation test revealed a mean QoS performance improvement of 40.13% in terms of session acceptance ratio with respect to the compared algorithms while keeping bounded operational and data-transfer costs. Our algorithm reveals useful to help market entry of new cloud-hosted live-video vCDN as-a-service players because it converges to smart SFC deployment policies under traffic peaks and bounded network resource capacity.
